<h2>Introduction</h2>
</div>

Excel Output Transformation is an Office of National Statistics project
to automate conversion from spreadsheets to datasets.

The layout of a particular spreadsheet is configured in a *recipe*. 
A recipe is a short script which explains where to find the observations
in the spreadsheet, and how to find the values of dimensions for each
observation.
