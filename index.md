<h2>Introduction</h2>
</div>

Excel Output Transformation (EOT) is an Office of National Statistics project
to automate conversion from spreadsheets to datasets.

The layout of a particular spreadsheet is configured in a *recipe*. 
A recipe is a short script which explains where to find the observations
in the spreadsheet, and how to find the values of dimensions for each
observation.

DataBaker then uses this recipe to convert Excel spreadsheets into usable data.

You can think of this as "unpivoting" and cleaning a spreadsheet, in a
very general and powerful way.
