<a href="https://quickcode.io/">QuickCode On-Premises</a> for the 
<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/">Office of National 
Statistics</a> automates conversion from spreadsheets to datasets.

The layout of a particular spreadsheet is configured in a *recipe*. 
A recipe is a short script which explains where to find the observations
in the spreadsheet, and how to find the values of dimensions for each
observation.

A command-line tool called *DataBaker* then uses this recipe to convert Excel
spreadsheets into usable data.

You can think of this as "unpivoting" and cleaning a spreadsheet, in a
very general and powerful way.
