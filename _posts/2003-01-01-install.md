### Operating system

EOT is designed to run on Windows 7. There's no specific reason it shouldn't
run on later versions of Windows, or even other operating systems, but it
was created for that version of Windows.

### Python

The easiest way of getting Python on Windows is to install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads).

Download the Python 2.7 installer for your OS: if not sure, try the 32-bit version.

The default options should work well.

### Language modules

From the Windows command line type:

```sh
pip install databaker
```

This will install databaker and all its prerequisites that aren't installed with Anaconda.

### Upgrading

If you have `databaker` installed already and want to upgrade to the
latest version, then from the Windows command line type:

```sh
pip install --upgrade databaker
```
