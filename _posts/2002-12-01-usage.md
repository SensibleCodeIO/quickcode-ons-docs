### Command line usage

Running `bake --help` will give you details of the command line arguments.

Generally you'll run `bake recipe.py spreadsheet.xls`. You can use multiple spreadsheets (including wildcards).

By default, a CSV file is generated in the same folder as the spreadsheet called `data-recipe-spreadsheet.csv`. You can turn this off by putting `--nocsv` before the recipe.

You can also get a coloured version of the spreadsheet in the same folder called `preview-recipe-spreadsheet.xls` by using `--preview`.

You can also suppress some of the output by adding `--notiming`.

#### Running from a Windows batch file

`bake` can be used in a batch file.

For example, if we place the recipes `earn01.py` and `earn03.py`
along with the relevant spreadsheets `table-earn01.xls` and
`table-earn03.xls` and add this batch file `process.bat` all
together in the same directory:

```sh
bake earn01.py table-earn01.xls
bake earn03.py table-earn03.xls
```

Running `process.bat` will then process both of the spreadsheets
with `databaker` in which they appear in the batch file.

### Downloading examples

Some example spreadsheets and recipes are available from https://github.com/scraperwiki/eot-recipes

Or download them directly from https://github.com/scraperwiki/eot-recipes/archive/master.zip

### Text editor

You can use any text editor to edit recipes.

[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is a good one for Windows with syntax highlighting.

We recommend turning tabs into spaces:

Settings -> Preferences... -> Language Menu/Tab Settings -> Tab Settings (group) -> Replace by space

4-space tabs are standard in Python.
