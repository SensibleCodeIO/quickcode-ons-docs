### Command line usage

Running `bake --help` will give you details of the command line arguments.

Generally you'll run `bake recipe.py spreadsheet.xls`. You can use multiple spreadsheets (including wildcards).

By default, a CSV file is generated in the same folder as the spreadsheet called `data-recipe-spreadsheet.csv`. You can turn this off by putting `--nocsv` before the recipe.

You can also get a coloured version of the spreadsheet in the same folder called `preview-recipe-spreadsheet.xls` by using `--preview`.

You can also suppress some of the output by adding `--notiming`.

### Downloading examples

Some example spreadsheets and recipes are available from https://github.com/scraperwiki/eot-recipes

Or download them directly from https://github.com/scraperwiki/eot-recipes/archive/master.zip

### Text editor

You can use any text editor to edit recipes.

[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is a good one for Windows with syntax highlighting.

We recommend turning tabs into spaces:

Settings -> Preferences... -> Language Menu/Tab Settings -> Tab Settings (group) -> Replace by space

4-space tabs are standard in Python.
