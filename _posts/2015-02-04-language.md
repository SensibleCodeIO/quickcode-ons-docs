### Example recipe

The recipes are written in a special language. They look like this:

```python
from databaker.constants import *

def per_file(tableset):
    return "*"

def per_tab(tab):
    obs = tab.filter("MGSL").assert_one().shift(DOWN).fill(RIGHT).fill(DOWN).filter(is_number).is_not_italic

    tab.col('A').one_of(['Male', 'Female', 'All Persons']).is_header('gender', UP)
    tab.col('A').regex("...-... (?:19|20)\d\d").is_header(TIME, LEFT, strict=True)
    tab.regex("All aged .*").is_header('ages', UP)
    tab.filter("Total economically active").fill(LEFT).fill(RIGHT).is_not_blank.is_header('indicator_', UP, strict=True)

    return obs
```

They're written in the Python programming language. You don't need to know that
to make basic changes - it's useful to know if you need to do anything more
complicated and want help or training.

### Header line
```python
from databaker.constants import *
```

This is just boilerplate: it needs to be at the start of each file.

### Per File
```python
def per_file(tableset)
```

Here we say which tabs in the Excel spreadsheet we're interested in.

Options include:

* Explicit names of tables as strings
 
```python
def per_file(tabs):
    return "My Table"                    # one table called 'My Table'
    # or
    return ["This Table", "That Table"]  # two tables with specific names
    # or
    return "*"                           # all tables
```

* Using a list of table names to inform decisions:

```python
def per_file(tabs):
    tablist = tabs.names         # get a list of names
    tablist.discard('Notes')     # remove names from list
    tablist.discard('CV notes')
    return tablist
```

* Returning the tables themselves

```python
def per_file(tabs):
    return tabs  # all tables
```

This last one is potentially useful for selecting tables based on the contents of their cells;

```python
def per_file(tabs):
    for tab in tabs:
        if tab.excel_ref("A1").value == '2014':
            yield tab
```
